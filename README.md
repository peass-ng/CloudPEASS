# Cloud Privilege Escalation Awesome Script Suite 🚀🛡️

![/cloudpeass.png](/cloudpeass.png)

Welcome to the **Cloud Privilege Escalation Awesome Script Suite** – your one-stop solution to **find your permissions** whenever you compromise a principal in a **Red Team** across major cloud platforms: **Azure, GCP, and AWS**. This suite is designed to help you determine all your permissions and also what it's possible to accomplish with them, focusing on **privilege escalation** and accessing **sensitive information** 🔥, and other potential attack vectors **without modifying any resources**.

This toolkit leverages advanced techniques to enumerate your permissions (it uses different permission enumeration techniques depending on the cloud) and utilizes insights from **[HackTricks Cloud](https://cloud.hacktricks.wiki/en/index.html)** and the shared permission categorizations maintained in that book to classify permissions as **critical / high / medium / low**.

The bundled categorizations for AWS, GCP, Azure, and Kubernetes update weekly from HackTricks Cloud. See [maintaining the shared categorizations](docs/permission-categorization-sync.md).

Permission ratings follow the shared [severity policy](docs/permission-severity-policy.md), with [audited source evidence](docs/permission-severity-audit.csv).

<summary><h2>AzurePEAS 💼🖥️</h2></summary>

**AzurePEAS** enumerates the effective permissions of a compromised user, service principal, or managed identity in Azure Resource Manager and Microsoft Entra ID. It performs no Azure write/delete operations and never executes commands inside workloads.

### Enumeration order and fallbacks

1. **Token claims (no directory permissions required):** identifies the principal and records Graph `scp`, `roles`, and `wids` claims. These are useful even when every Graph enumeration endpoint returns `403`.
2. **Effective ARM permissions:** asks Azure's permissions endpoint at every discovered subscription, resource group, resource, management group, and explicitly supplied scope. This does not require permission to list IAM role assignments.
3. **IAM reconstruction:** when allowed, lists transitive ARM/Entra assignments, role definitions, conditions, and PIM-eligible roles. Failure here does not stop other methods.
4. **Resource discovery evidence:** successful read-only subscription, resource-group, and resource calls are reported even when IAM cannot be read.
5. **Azure CLI fallback:** when `--use-az-cli` is used and ARM returns no permissions, AzurePEAS can probe Azure CLI commands that are demonstrably read-only and require no arguments. It uses no shell, disables dynamic extension installation and prompts, and skips unknown or potentially state-changing commands. Use `--azure-services` to make this faster or `--skip-az-cli-fallback` to disable it.

If resource listing is denied but you know an ARM resource ID from a VM's metadata, logs, scripts, or a previous foothold, pass it with `--scopes`. AzurePEAS will query that scope directly. This is the most reliable low-permission fallback.

### Authentication

- Reuse an existing Azure CLI login: `--use-az-cli` (recommended when available).
- Supply ARM/Graph access tokens with arguments or `AZURE_ARM_TOKEN` / `AZURE_GRAPH_TOKEN`.
- Use device code with MFA by running without credentials.
- Use username/password or service-principal credentials with `--use-username-password` (legacy; no MFA).
- Supply an existing FOCI refresh token with `--foci-refresh-token` to try the optional M365 checks.

Tokens are never printed. Prefer environment variables over command-line arguments because command-line values may be visible in process listings. `AZURE_PASSWORD` and `AZURE_FOCI_REFRESH_TOKEN` are supported.

Known ARM and Microsoft Graph audiences for Azure public, US Government/DoD, and China clouds (plus legacy Germany ARM) are routed only to their matching trusted API host. Azure CLI authentication follows the cloud configured in `az`; optional FOCI/M365 features still depend on service availability in that cloud.

### Microsoft 365 quick checks

With a usable FOCI refresh token, AzurePEAS performs bounded, read-only checks for SharePoint, OneDrive, Outlook, Teams, OneNote, contacts, and tasks. Use `--not-enumerate-m365` to omit them. These checks indicate accessible data; they are not intended to download a complete tenant.

### Examples

```bash
# Reuse the current az login and enumerate one subscription
python3 AzurePEAS.py --use-az-cli --check-only-these-subs <SUBSCRIPTION_ID>

# Tokens from the environment
export AZURE_ARM_TOKEN="<ARM_TOKEN>"
export AZURE_GRAPH_TOKEN="<GRAPH_TOKEN>"
python3 AzurePEAS.py --no-ask

# Resource-list fallback: check exact known scopes directly
python3 AzurePEAS.py --arm-token "<TOKEN>" \
  --check-only-these-subs <SUBSCRIPTION_ID> \
  --scopes "/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<VAULT>"

# Limit the last-resort CLI probes
python3 AzurePEAS.py --use-az-cli --azure-services vm,keyvault,storage

# ARM only, JSON report
python3 AzurePEAS.py --use-az-cli --skip-entraid --out-json-path azure-results.json

# Full option reference
python3 AzurePEAS.py --help

<summary><h2>GCPPEAS 🌐🔍</h2></summary>

**GCPPEAS** enumerates the current principal's effective GCP permissions and highlights privilege-escalation and sensitive-access paths. Its transport rejects non-read-only endpoints: it never creates, changes, enables, executes, invokes, starts, stops, or deletes cloud resources.

### How it works

GCPPEAS layers several independent techniques so a denied enumeration call does not stop the scan:

1. **Permissionless/local clues:** explicit `--project`, `--service-account`, and repeatable `--resource` values are always tested. `--group` preserves a known current-principal group membership when Cloud Identity discovery is denied. On a GCP workload, the metadata server supplies the current project, VM, and attached service account without IAM permissions. Credential and standard project environment variables are also used.
2. **Container and resource discovery:** Resource Manager search, Cloud Asset Inventory, and independent service-specific list calls discover projects, folders, organizations, VMs, Functions, buckets, service accounts, secrets, Cloud Run services/jobs, Artifact Registry repositories, Pub/Sub topics/subscriptions/snapshots, BigQuery datasets/tables/routines, Workflows, KMS key rings/keys, Cloud DNS managed zones, Agent Identity auth providers, and Integration Connector connections. Each failure is isolated and summarized; regional fallbacks continue when only some locations are denied. Connector discovery uses BASIC view and never requests stored authentication data.
3. **Effective permission tests:** Google's `queryTestablePermissions` supplies the current, resource-applicable catalog and `testIamPermissions` checks it in batches. These methods avoid parsing platform-dependent `gcloud help` output. If catalog lookup fails, GCPPEAS falls back to official predefined roles, a public catalog, and finally a built-in core set. Failed or partial tests are reported rather than silently treated as zero permissions.
4. **IAM policy supplement:** where `getIamPolicy` is allowed, direct/public/domain/known-group bindings and custom roles add context. Visible group bindings are reported without claiming that the group is joinable; the output points operators to the relevant Google Groups settings. Static grants are never merged over a successful effective test because IAM Deny, principal access boundaries, or request conditions may block them. If effective testing is unavailable, policy permissions are retained but clearly labeled as unverified. BigQuery datasets, which do not expose a dataset-level `testIamPermissions` method, use read-only metadata/list capability probes; BigQuery itself documents that table/routine tests can fail open.

Knowing a resource name is often enough to test permissions even when the principal cannot list its parent. Examples:

```bash
python3 GCPPEAS.py --project victim-project --only-specified
python3 GCPPEAS.py --resource gs://known-bucket --only-specified
python3 GCPPEAS.py --resource projects/victim-project/secrets/known-secret --only-specified
python3 GCPPEAS.py --resource projects/victim-project/datasets/known_dataset/tables/known_table --only-specified
python3 GCPPEAS.py --resource //run.googleapis.com/projects/victim-project/locations/us-central1/services/known-service --only-specified
python3 GCPPEAS.py --resource dns-zone:projects/victim-project/managedZones/known-zone --only-specified
python3 GCPPEAS.py --resource agent-auth-provider:projects/victim-project/locations/us-central1/authProviders/known-provider --only-specified
python3 GCPPEAS.py --resource integration-connector:projects/victim-project/locations/us-central1/connections/known-connection --only-specified
```

`--billing-project` only sets the quota-project header; GCPPEAS never enables an API or changes billing/IAM. Read calls and `testIamPermissions` can still appear in audit or access logs, so read-only does not mean invisible.

### Authentication

Authentication follows the same fallback style as the other PEASS tools:

- `--token`, then `CLOUDSDK_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `--sa-credentials-path`, then `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
- Application Default Credentials, including workload metadata credentials

Examples:

```bash
# Existing gcloud user session
export CLOUDSDK_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN="$(gcloud auth print-access-token)"
python3 GCPPEAS.py --project victim-project --only-specified

# Service-account JSON
python3 GCPPEAS.py --sa-credentials-path credentials.json --project victim-project

# ADC / attached workload identity
python3 GCPPEAS.py

# Keep output locally for later analysis
python3 GCPPEAS.py --project victim-project --out-json-path gcp-results.json
```

GCPPEAS reports Workspace-capable OAuth scopes—including Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Admin SDK, Chat, Classroom, and editors—but does not automatically read Workspace content. A token containing both Workspace and Cloud scopes is called out as a cross-control-plane credential. Service-account impersonation/signing/key permissions distinguish directly shared Workspace resources (which do not require domain-wide delegation) from user impersonation through DWD. Complete Cloud DNS record-write pairs, user access to organization `setIamPolicy`, live-tested HTTP Workspace add-on deployment takeover, Agent Identity credential vaults, decrypted Application Integration auth profiles, and invoke-only Application Integration access receive concise GCP↔Workspace pivot notes with their required conditions and known-resource fallbacks.

### Useful controls

- `--only-specified`: avoid broad container searches and scan only supplied projects/resources.
- `--skip-iam-policies`: use the permissionless `testIamPermissions` path without policy reads.
- `--skip-bruteforce`: policy-only mode; usually less complete.
- `--skip-asset-inventory`: use service-specific discovery fallbacks only.
- `--resource`: repeat for known resource names; comma-separated values are also accepted.
- `--group`: known current-principal group email(s), used when Cloud Identity membership lookup is denied.
- `--billing-project`: quota project only; no state change.
- `--threads`, `--timeout`, `--retries`: bound concurrency and transient failures.
- `--proxy`, `--insecure`, `--debug`: troubleshooting controls.

Run `python3 GCPPEAS.py --help` for the complete current option list.

<summary><h2>AWSPEAS ⚡️🔐</h2></summary>

**AWSPEAS** enumerates the current AWS principal's permissions and highlights privilege-escalation and sensitive-access opportunities while leaving the target unchanged. It never calls AWS create, update, delete, invoke, run, start, send, or execute operations.

### How It Works

AWSPEAS uses three permission-free-or-read-only fallbacks:

1. **IAM policy reads:** Reads the current user or role, all paginated inline/attached/group policies, managed-policy default versions, resource scopes, conditions, explicit denies, `NotAction`, `NotResource`, and permissions boundaries. If granular calls are blocked, it tries `GetAccountAuthorizationDetails` independently.

2. **IAM simulation:** If policy visibility is partial, empty, conditional, or boundary-limited, it tries `SimulatePrincipalPolicy`. Simulation is read-only and does not execute the tested actions. Because AWS otherwise evaluates resource-scoped actions against `*`, AWSPEAS uses explicitly supplied `--resource-arn` values and safely discovered Secrets Manager ARNs for a second resource-specific pass. Assumed-role sessions are resolved to their IAM role ARN when IAM permits it. The AWS action catalog falls back to installed botocore models when the online AWS catalog is unavailable.

3. **Live read-only probes:** If both methods above are incomplete, AWSPEAS tests only read command families (`List`, `Get`, `Describe`, `BatchGet`, `Head`, `Lookup`, and `Search`). The AWS CLI is optional unless this fallback is needed. Help parsing supports plain, groff, and Unicode bullet formats, with botocore service models as an OS-independent fallback. Inventory reads run before dependent reads; successful JSON responses supply bounded resource IDs and other required parameters for later reads in the same service. This can confirm permissions that fabricated IDs cannot test. Large inventory probes use small, validated page sizes. AWSPEAS keeps only selected identifiers, redacts them from probe logs, and retains the existing dummy-ID fallback. For WorkMail and the WorkSpaces family, AWSPEAS can also recover option-matched resource IDs from successful CloudTrail history; failed-event parameters are rejected to prevent false-positive feedback loops. Use `--aws-services` to limit requests or `--bruteforce-always` to check for resource-policy access even after complete IAM reads.

Optional managed-policy inference can suggest unconfirmed permissions from successful live probes. Inferred permissions are labeled separately and must not be treated as confirmed.

AWS authorization can also depend on SCPs, RCPs, session policies, resource policies, VPC endpoint policies, request context, and service-specific behavior. AWSPEAS reports these limitations rather than presenting static policy statements as universally effective access.

### Operational Security Considerations ⚠️

- **Canary detection:** AWSPEAS first tries to decode the account ID locally from modern AKIA/ASIA access-key IDs. This can stop before the first STS call for known canary accounts. It then checks the returned ARN/name for canary patterns. With `--no-ask`, a possible canary stops safely.
- **CloudTrail:** Read calls can still be logged. "Read-only" means no target state is intentionally changed, not that the scan is invisible.


### Authentication & Execution Requirements

AWSPEAS accepts an AWS profile, explicit credentials, or the normal boto3 credential chain (environment variables, container/instance roles, web identity, and configured defaults). A region is optional; it uses the session/environment region and then `us-east-1`. The AWS CLI is needed only for live probes.
